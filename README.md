# Taloon

## What is Taloon?
Taloon is an extremely basic game that was made over the course of an afternoon to get some practice with Livewire, Tailwind and Alpine. The premise is that you are a shopkeeper in a roleplaying game who hires adventurers to go into dungeons to obtain items that you can sell for gold.
